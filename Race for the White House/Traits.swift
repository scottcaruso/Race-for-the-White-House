  //Political traits
  //These are the traits that relate to a politician or state's POLITICAL leanings - as in, how they feel about a particular issue. These range from -50 to 50, with 0 being "true neutral." Negative numbers mean MORE liberal approaching -50, while positive numbers mean MORE conservative approaching 50.
  
  // Universal Healthcare
  //    -50 is a full socialist, single-payer program subsidized heavily by taxes
  //      0 is maintenance of the current Obamacare plan
  //     50 is full repeal of Obamacare, no replacement, complete free-market, insurance-based and unregulated system
  
  var universalHeathcare = 0
  
  // Gay rights
  //    -50 is pushing for a constitutional amendment that guarantees the rights of same-sex couples to marry
  //      0 is allowing the current rule of law to stay in place, and leaving the decision up to the states
  //     50 is pushing for a constitutional amendment that disallows same-sex marriages, dissolves any existing same-sex marriages, and nullifies any existing state laws guaranteeing these rights

  // Homeland security
  //    -50 is the abolishment of the Department of Homeland Security
  //      0 is no change to the current DHS system
