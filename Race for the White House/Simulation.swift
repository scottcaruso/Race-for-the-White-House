Right now, it averages the candidates' notorieties. If the average is greater than the state's desired notoriety, the maximum turnout is achieved. If not, the average notoriety is used to calculate the turnout. For instance, if the state is looking for 15 notoriety from a candidate, and the average of the two candidates is 17, then turnoutLimits.turnoutMax will be the turnout. However, if the state is looking for 18 notoriety, the two candidates would return a 62% turnout.
